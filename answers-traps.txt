1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
the arguments 1, 2, 3 are stored in register a0, a1, a2 separately, the 13 is stored in register a2.

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
the call to function f and g has been inlined.

3. At what address is the function printf located?
the function printf is located in address 0x630

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x34

5. Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output?

The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

the output is "He110 World"
if the RISC-V were big-endian, then need set i = 0x726c6400

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

there maybe print a random value.
